## Login

When starting the app, you will be prompted to log in to your Bourso account.

Use your client ID and password to log in. This data will be sent to Bourso servers only.

You can choose to save your password for future logins. If you choose not to save your password, you will be prompted to enter it each time you start the app.  
> ⚠️ Beware that saving your password locally means that anyone with enough access to your computer can retrieve your credentials.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the main screen of the app. It displays your assets, accounts, and orders.

### Assets

By default, the app will display the assets you own. You can add or remove assets from the list by clicking the button on the top right corner of the charts section.

> ℹ️ To setup an automatic DCA or place an order on an asset, make sure it is in the list.

For instance, if you want to add AIRBUS to the list, you will need its ticker symbol. You can find it on the Bourso in the URL, e.g. `https://www.boursorama.com/cours/1rPAIR/` where `1rPAIR` is the ticker symbol.

Then you can just type `1rPAIR` in the search bar and click on the add button. The app will then fetch the asset data and display it in the list.

### Orders

The orders section displays your previous orders **made with the app**. Orders made on the Bourso website will not be displayed here. 

You can place an order by clicking on the button on the top right corner of the orders section.

> ℹ️ Only the assets you have added to the assets list will be available for trading. If you want to trade an asset, make sure to add it beforehand.

### DCA

Automatic DCA is a feature that allows you to automatically buy a specific asset at a defined interval. You can choose to buy the asset daily, weekly, or monthly.

To setup an automatic DCA, click on the button on the top right corner of the dashboard.

You will get a popup that explains the feature and ask for your permission to proceed with the installation. You will be able to configure which asset you want to buy, the amount, and the interval on the next screen.

> ⚠️ On MacOS you need to authorize the app to run in the background by clicking on authorize in the popup.

On the next screen, you can configure the DCA. You can choose the asset, the amount, and the interval.

You can also delete the DCA by clicking on the delete button next to the automatic DCA. If you want to deactivate all the DCAs, you can do it at the bottom of the popup.
