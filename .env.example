# Development Mode Configuration
# Set to 'true' to enable development mode with mock data and skip login
VITE_DEV_MODE=false

# When VITE_DEV_MODE is true:
# - Login page is skipped automatically
# - Mock accounts and assets data are used
# - No need to authenticate with real credentials
# This allows quick testing of the dashboard without going through login flow
